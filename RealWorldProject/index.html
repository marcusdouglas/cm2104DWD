      <h3>What are scams using missed calls and text messages from unknown numbers?</h2>
      <p>
        <img src = "images/image1.jpeg" id = "image">
        Missed call scams start by ringing your phone and hanging up so quickly
          that you can’t answer the call in time. Your phone registers a missed
          call and you probably won’t recognize the number. People will often
          then call the number back to find out who it is. Apart from being a
          nuisance, the missed call can lead to a scam in two ways

          The number you call back may be redirected to a premium rate service
          (a number that starts with 09) without your knowledge, which means
          you will be charged a lot of money per minute.

          The number may tell you that you have won a prize of some sort and
          give you another number to call to ‘claim’ your prize, but they may
          not tell you how much the call will cost. This second number may be
          a premium rate number, again charging you a lot of money to get your
          prize.

          Text message scams work by sending you a text message from a number you
          may not recognize, but the content of the message could sound like it’s
          from a friend—for instance "Hi, it’s John. I’m back! When do you want to
          catch up?" or "Hey big fella, happy birthday!". Another common tactic is
          for a text message to sound like someone flirting with you. Many people
          reply asking who it is and end up engaging in a lengthy SMS exchange with
          the scammer. Only later do they find out that they have been charged a high
          rate both for messages they sent (sometimes there are also charges for
          messages received as well).

          <p><h3>Warning signs</h3>
            <li>You receive a ‘missed call’ from a number that you don’t recognize.</li>
            <li>You didn’t hear your phone ring.</li>
            <li>The number starts with 09 (which is a premium rate service)</li>
            <li>You receive a text message from a number you don’t recognize, but
              which sounds like it’s from a friend.</li>
            <li>If you return a missed call, a recorded message asks you to dial
              a different number (often starting with 09) but the cost of the call
              is not clearly stated.</li>

            <h3>Protect yourself from scams using missed calls and text messages from unknown numbers</h3>
            <li>It is best not to respond to text messages or missed calls that come
              from numbers you don’t recognize.</li>
            <li>Be careful of phone numbers beginning with 09. These are charged
              at a premium rate and can be very expensive.</li>
            <li>Look out for SMS and MMS numbers that start with 09. These are
              charged at a premium rate (sometimes even for receiving a message)
              and can be very expensive.</li>

            <h3>Report them</h3>
            If you have received such a call or text, or if you have returned the
            call or text and you now realize it is a scam, you can report it on our
            website. You should also spread the word to your friends and family to
            protect them.
